# ⚛️🏦 TheReact-ReduxBank (part of the course)

A project built with React and Redux to practice state management, slice-based logic, and global state handling.  
This project was created as part of a course to improve my Redux skills and is also part of my personal portfolio. The application focuses on logic and state flow rather than UI.

## 📦 Technologies

* `React`
* `Redux`
* `@reduxjs/toolkit`
* `JavaScript`
* `npm`
* `create-react-app`

---

## 🦄 Features

Here’s what you can do with **Redux Intro**:

* **State Management with Redux**
  The application demonstrates how to manage global state using Redux and `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

* **Slice-Based Logic**
  State is divided into slices for better modularity and scalability.

* **Actions and Reducers**
  Actions and reducers are used to handle state transitions in a predictable way.

* **Middleware Integration**
  Middleware is used to handle asynchronous logic and side effects.

* **Scalable Architecture**
  The project is structured to allow easy addition of new features and slices.

## 🎯 Application Flow

The application is based on Redux's unidirectional data flow:

1. **Dispatch Actions**  
   Components dispatch actions to trigger state changes.

2. **Reducers Update State**  
   Reducers handle actions and update the state accordingly.

3. **State Propagation**  
   The updated state is propagated to all subscribed components.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me better understand how to structure and manage state in a React-Redux application.

* **Redux Toolkit**
  I learned how to use `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and other utilities provided by Redux Toolkit to simplify Redux development.

* **Slice-Based State Management**
  Dividing state into slices made the application more modular and easier to maintain.

* **Middleware**
  I gained experience integrating middleware for handling asynchronous logic.

* **Redux DevTools**
  Debugging state changes using Redux DevTools improved my understanding of the application's data flow.

## 💭 Possible Improvements

* Adding more slices for additional features
* Improving the UI and adding animations and style
